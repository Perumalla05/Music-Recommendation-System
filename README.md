# 🎵 Music Recommendation System 🎶

## Description
The **Music Recommendation System** leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques to recommend songs based on their lyrics. By analyzing the textual content of songs, this project provides users with song suggestions that match the style or mood they seek. 🔊

## Features
- **Text-Based Recommendation:** Uses TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to recommend songs. 🎼
- **Efficient Data Handling:** Processes a large dataset of song lyrics to deliver meaningful suggestions. ✨
- **Customizable Parameters:** Allows flexibility in how recommendations are generated. 🔧

## Dataset Information
- **Source:** The dataset consists of song titles and their corresponding lyrics. 📖
- **Sample Size:** The project uses a sample of 5,000 songs after pre-processing. ✅

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python 💻
- **Libraries:**
  - `pandas` for data manipulation 🧲
  - `scikit-learn` for TF-IDF vectorization and similarity calculations ⚙️
  - `numpy` for numerical operations 0️⃣


## How It Works
- **Data Preprocessing:**
  - Cleans and formats the song lyrics data. 🗑️
  - Removes unnecessary characters for efficient processing. 🔄
- **TF-IDF Vectorization:**
  - Converts the lyrics into numerical vectors based on term frequencies. 🌀
- **Cosine Similarity:**
  - Computes the similarity between input lyrics and the dataset to generate recommendations. 1️⃣
